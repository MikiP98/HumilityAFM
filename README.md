FAQ: <br>
q: Why don’t I see LED in my game? <br>
a: You need to enable them in config and restart the game. I thought they aren't vanilla enough to include them by default. <br>
q: Why don’t my LEDs emit coloured light? <br>
a: You need to install "Shimmer" mod alongside this one to get the coloured lights. If you already installed it and LEDs still don't emit coloured light, there is probably some incompatibility. Try disabling "NVIDIUM" mod and it should start working again.
